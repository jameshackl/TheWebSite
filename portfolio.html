					<h2>Gameboy Emulator</h2>
					<p> My GameBoy emulator is a study of how computer hardware works at a fundemental level and how to replicate the behavior in code.
						Additionally, I would need to learn about graphics output, sound output, capturing input, and emulating the CPU and memory within.
						The GameBoy is a well engineered machine where everything works in a tight choreography and every game made for it follows this.
						Translating it into code, although fundementally easy, is difficult to time properly.

					<h2>Crypto-Currency Arbitrage</h2>
					<p>Crypto currencies are a really neat and novel invention. Just the amount of forethought and security baked into them is impressive.
						I don't claim to know all their is to know about them or the intricacies of various trading straegies but arbitrage is one that is mathematically defineable.
						Arbitrage is simply taking advantage price inefficiencies. Someone is selling too low or buying too high.

					<h2>This Website</h2>
					<p>Web development is not my main area of focus but everything, everybody, and their dog seems to have a website so learning the basics is essential.
						This webiste does not aim to be the best but moreso a place to showcase what I can create.
